# booking-agent-profile

Shared, keyless USP/UCP platform profile for the USP Agent.

Businesses fetch the profile at:

`https://profile.booking-agent.dev/platform-profile.json`

The document is keyless: it carries no signing keys. One profile is used for the whole platform.

This repository publishes the committed `platform-profile.json` artifact at the URL above (GitHub Pages, HTTPS).

## Validate locally

If you clone this repository:

```bash
python3 tools/build.py
python3 -m pytest -q
```

Those checks confirm the committed JSON matches the vendored USP/UCP schemas and stays keyless. They do not own the document content.
